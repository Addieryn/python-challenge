Help from Tutor Khangwelo with finding my Change variables in the code next_change[], and printing month of line for increase[0] and decrease[0]
    Also asked about an easy way to round down using .2f
Xpert showed me how to seperate the csv output without a "," after every letter
    (I didn't realize I could use an f string in the middle and not just the beginning)
